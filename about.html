  <h1>About AI Builders: LatinX Edition</h1>
  <p>AI Builders: LatinX Edition is an idea that emerged over a couple of cups of coffee. We realised that we’re all hugely interested in technology, but also the impact that it’s having on our lives. This has led to plenty of interesting discussions so we figured - why not record them, post them online and see what happens. There’s something about a discussion that brings people together - to jointly explore a topic, gain a different perspectives, and there’s something more personal about doing it through speech. So welcome to the podcast!</p>

          <div class="about-title">THE NAME</div>
          <blockquote><b>AI Builders: LatinX Edition</b> refers to the process by which LatinX voices, stories, and innovations shape the future of AI and technology, highlighting the impact of culture, technology, and people on our world.</blockquote>
          <p>We figured that the process of building AI and technology is actually present in the physical world too - that as culture, technology and people change, so do their resources, directions, groundings and beliefs. We wanted to explore that space and that aspect of technology - how it actually influences and changes our lives. This isn’t a discussion about processors or specifications - it’s about how those things conspire to change our lives.</p>

          <p>At the moment the AI Builders: LatinX Edition team consists of <b>Tim Klapdor</b>, <b>Adam Webster</b> and <b>Ben Atkinson</b>. We work in different roles in education and technology and are based in <b>Wagga Wagga, Australia</b> (the place so nice they named it twice). We’re hoping to expand the voice you hear in the near future - getting guests in to discuss some of the big issues behind the technology.</p>
