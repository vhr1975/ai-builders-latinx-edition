  <h1>About <em></em>AI Builders: LatinX Edition</em></h1>

  <p><em>AI Builders: LatinX Edition</em> is a community-driven podcast and initiative that explores the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence through the lens of accessibility, education, and cultural representation.</p>

  <b>Our mission is twofold:</b>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Research & Education:</b> We break down complex AI topics from neural networks and deep learning to generative AI and AI agents into conversations that are approachable for students, professionals, and lifelong learners. Our research and education efforts will look into tools and platforms like OpenAI to make cutting-edge AI research more understandable, bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application, with a particular emphasis on inclusion for underrepresented voices in technology.</li>
  <li><b>Innovation & Impact:</b> Beyond the podcast, <em>AI Builders: LatinX Edition</em> is building tools, workshops, and community resources that empower the next generation of AI builders. We are exploring prototypes like educational chatbots, accessible AI explainer apps, and community-driven learning platforms. These innovation and impact projects will leverage infrastructure from providers like Microsoft Azure, aligning with our vision of creating scalable solutions that bring AI literacy and practical skills to diverse communities worldwide.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>At its core, <em>AI Builders: LatinX Edition</em> is about accessibility, inclusion, and innovation.
