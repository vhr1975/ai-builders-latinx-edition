### Can someone explain drones to me?

Drones seem to be the big thing at the moment - they line the shelves in every electronics store around the country. They range in price from $50 to $5000 and can be purpose built for applications from photography through to racing. But with a battery life of about 20 minutes usage is pretty short. They’re delicate, they can't contend with weather, they can’t carry much, and they’re really noisy. So why the hell are they touted the next big thing?
